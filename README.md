# Android RSS Viewer

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Park-Wonbin/android-rss-viewer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Park-Wonbin/android-rss-viewer)

Android RSS Viewer refines meaningful elements of rss and provides real-time summary to users in slider form. It provides a wonderful UX to users for watching collection of subscribed news.

We used our awesome android-live-slider library for developing our application.
